A fabric 1.19.2 minecraft mod originally made to recreate the Random-Things spectre key.

This is the first time I code in Java, and also the first time I make a minecraft mod. I know the code is horrible and it could be made to run better, but I dont really care

## Items
Nil Key: Allows you to teleport in/out of your personal 32x32x32 dimension.

Charged Nil Key: Same as Nil Key but you can sneak + right click mobs to teleport them into your dimension. Right clicking on a block brings out a random mob from your personal dimension.

Nil Pearl: Lets you throw a random entity in your personal dimension like a snowball.

Charged Nil Key Tag: Prevents mobs from being pulled out of your personal dimension with the Charged Nil Key.

Nil Pearl Tag: Prevents mobs from being thrown out of your personal dimension with the Nil Pearl.

The Nil: this is the Charged Nil Key, Nil Pearl, Pearl Tag, and Charged Nil Key Tag in one item. You can cycle through the item with the default keys Z and X.

## Blocks

Pearl Detector: Works only in your personal dimension. It emits a redstone pulse when you use a Nil Pearl.

Charged Nil Key Detector: Works only in your personal dimension. It emits a redstone pulse when you use a Charged Nil Key to pull out an entity.

Nil Projector: Shoots a projectile upwards on redstone signal. It can carry 6 charges at a time and takes around 3 seconds to gain a charge.
